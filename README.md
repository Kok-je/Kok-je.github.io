## CS50
>This was my final project for conclude the CS50 Introduction to Computer Sciense course.

>CS, python, HTML, CSS, JS, web development
## Details

- HTML & CSS for interface
- JS for arcade game
- Neumorphism soft UI design concept

## Explaining the project and the features
My final project is a personal portfolio website that showcases my personal photography and digital art works. There is also a section on my resume, and the most interesting part is the arcade page, where users can challenge themselves in a game against an AI bot.

### Home:
Navbar:
- interactive element that changes when hovered over
- box-shadows based on soft design principles
- links to each key page of the website

Aboutme:
- short paragraph about myself, my interests and passion
- interactive button to add to overall design aesthetic

Info Cards:
- Short description about each of the content pages
- Find out more button links to each of the individual pages
- interactive and responds when hovered over

Contact Bar:
- buttons that links to my social media pages

### Photography and Artworks:
- A short description about what street photography means to me
- interactive photo gallery that enlarges slightly when hovered over
- Clicking into an image enlarges it, click left/ right to navigate
- Interactive aspect made using lightbox plugin

### Resume:
- Digital portfolio to provide more information about past experiences and skills

### Arcade:
- In tictactoe, each player picks a symbol to represent X or O
- Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares of a 3 x 3 grid
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie
- The inspiration behind a tictactoe game came from an AI course that I am doing. Here you can play against an AI bot and try to achieve a draw
- The AI always picks the most ideal move and never loses, so the best result is a draw
- To play again, just simply press the play button. This will refresh the board
- made using JS

## About CS50
CS50 is a openware course from Havard University and taught by David J. Malan

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus studentsâ€™ choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development).

Thank you for all CS50.
